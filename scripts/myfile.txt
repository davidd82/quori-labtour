Leticia Pinto Alva: Leticia is a 2nd-year PhD student in the computer science department at USC, advised by Prof. Jesse Thomason. She received her B.S in computer science from the National University of Engineering (Lima, Peru). Her research interests include Machine Learning and Vision and Language.
Nathan Dennler: Nathan is a Ph.D. candidate in the computer science department at USC. He is co-advised by Prof. Maya Matahric and Prof. Stefanos Nikolaidis. He previously received a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.Eng. in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Their research focuses on empowering users to specify how robots adapt to them socially and physically, particularly in contexts where users have limited mobility.
A'di Dust: A'di is a first year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at USC. They graduated from Macalester College with a BA in Computer Science. They also worked with the Adaptive Human-Robot Teaming Laboratory at Rochester Institute of Technology.
Mina Kian: Mina is a 1st year Ph.D. student in the computer science department at USC, advised by Prof. Maya Matahric. She received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Minnesota. She is passionate about student advocacy and creating accessible infrastructure through her work.
Amy O'Connell: Amy is a third year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at USC. She received her BA in Computer Science from Vassar College and worked with the Autonomous Field Robotics Laboratory at the University of South Carolina.
Zhonghao Shi: Zhonghao is extremely interested in working on human-centered computational problems for people with special needs. Currently, he is working on designing computational models that could recognize the affective state of learning for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) so that we could respond with personalized feedback to proceed learning at an optimal pace for each child.
Kaleen Shrestha: Kayleen is a first year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at USC. She received a B.S. in Computer Science and an M.S. in Natural Language Processing from the University of California, Santa Cruz.

intro: Welcome to the USC Interaction Lab! The lab is led by prof. Maya Matahric, a chaired and distinguished professor of computer science, with appointments in neuroscience and pediatrics. She originally established the lab in 1995 at brandeis university. You can see the building of the original lab in the painting. The lab then moved to usc in 1997, and has grown ever since. The interaction lab focuses on research in socially assistive robotics--Human-robot interaction methods that support users in a variety of challenging contexts related to health and wellness. The lab's research has helped children with autism spectrum disorder improve social and cognitive skills, stroke patients to be motivated to do rehabilitation exercises, elderly users to be more physically active and socially connected, university students with ADHD to study more effectively, and users to practice cognitive behavioral therapy, mindful breathing, and other self-regulation strategies. The students in the interaction labs have conducted some of the most challenging and longest lasting user studies and data collections in the real world, including in therapy centers, schools, rehabilitation homes, nursing homes, and homes. We love what we do and hope our robots can keep getting better at helping people to be and do better. Now let's take a walk around the lab to hear about current Ph.D. Students and their research projects.
outro: That is the end of the tour! This interaction was put together by Undergraduate Students David Delgado and Joseph Liu. Thank you! I will hand the rest of the tour back to a human.
