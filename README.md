# Interaction Lab Robotic Tour Guide
Goal: We want a program that we can run when we have a lab tour group come in. A robot will move around the lab and introduce all of the Ph.D. Students to people who want to tour the lab.

Motivation: Since we are a human-robot interaction robotics lab, we should have a robot interaction for people who come to visit. By having a robot, we can help inspire people who come to visit our lab to enter the field of robotics.

Anticipated Approach: We can use the Astro robot to move around the room. Previously, we programmed the robot using Alexa skills, but Alexa skills are limited in what they can do. Instead, we can use text-to-speech to issue commands to the robot and use a blossom robot to have more fine-grained control over what happens during the interaction.

# Getting Started
In the 'src' folder run

'python3 quori_statemachine.py'

to begin the Astro Interaction Lab Tour.
