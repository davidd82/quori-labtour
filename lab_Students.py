  "Nathan Dennler" :  "Nathan is a Ph.D. candidate in the computer science department at USC. He is co-advised by Prof. Maja Matarić and\
 Prof. Stefanos Nikolaidis. He previously received a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.Eng. in Robotics Engineering from Worcester\
 Polytechnic Institute. Their research focuses on empowering users to specify how robots adapt to them socially and physically,\
 particularly in contexts where users have limited mobility.",

  "Amy O'Connell":     "Amy is a third year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at USC. She received her BA in Computer\
 Science from Vassar College and worked with the Autonomous Field Robotics Laboratory at the University of South Carolina.",

  "Mina Kian":        "Mina is a 1st year Ph.D. student in the computer science department at USC, advised by Prof. Maja Matarić.\
 She received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Minnesota. She is passionate about student advocacy and\
 creating accessible infrastructure through her work.",

  "Zhonghao Shi":      "Zhonghao is extremely interested in working on human-centered computational problems for people with special needs.\
 Currently, he is working on designing computational models that could recognize the affective state of learning for children with\
 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) so that we could respond with personalized feedback to proceed learning at an optimal pace for\
 each child.",

  "Leticia Pinto Alva":  "Leticia is a 2nd-year PhD student in the computer science department at USC, advised by Prof. Jesse Thomason.\
 She received her B.S in computer science from the National University of Engineering (Lima, Peru). Her research interests include\
 Machine Learning and Vision and Language.",

  "A'di Dust":  "A'di is a first year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at USC. They graduated from Macalester College\
 with a BA in Computer Science. They also worked with the Adaptive Human-Robot Teaming Laboratory at Rochester Institute of Technology.",

  "Kaleen Shrestha":  "Kaleen is a first year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at USC. She received a B.S.\
 in Computer Science and an M.S. in Natural Language Processing from the University of California, Santa Cruz.",
